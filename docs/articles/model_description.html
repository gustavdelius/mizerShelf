<p>On this page we present the details of the model. The model consists
of three components: 1) a collection of species modelled by <a href="#size-spectrum-dynamics">size spectrum dynamics</a>, 2) <a href="#carrion">carrion</a> and 3) <a href="#detritus">detritus</a>. We
discuss each of these in turn below.</p>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="size-spectrum-dynamics">Size spectrum dynamics<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#size-spectrum-dynamics"></a>
</h2>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="species-size-spectra">Species size spectra<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#species-size-spectra"></a>
</h3>
<p>The model assumes that, to a first approximation, an individual can
be characterized by its weight <span class="math inline">\(w\)</span>
and its species number <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> only. The
aim of the model is to calculate the size spectrum <span class="math inline">\(N_i(w)\)</span>, which is the <em>density</em> of
individuals of species <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> such that
<span class="math inline">\(\int_w^{w+dw}N_i(w)dw\)</span> is the
<em>number</em> of individuals of species <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> in the size interval <span class="math inline">\([w,w+dw]\)</span>. In other words: the number of
individuals in a size range is the area under the number density <span class="math inline">\(N_i(w)\)</span>.</p>
<p>The time evolution of the number density <span class="math inline">\(N_i(w)\)</span> is described by the McKendrick-von
Foerster equation, which is a transport equation describing the
transport of biomass from small to large individuals, with an additional
loss term due to fish mortality:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:MvF}
  \frac{\partial N_i(w)}{\partial t} + \frac{\partial g_i(w)
N_i(w)}{\partial w}
  = -\mu_i(w) N_i(w).
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p>The individual growth rate <span class="math inline">\(g_i(w)\)</span> is described below in the <a href="#growth">Growth</a> section and the mortality rate <span class="math inline">\(\mu_i(w)\)</span> is described in the <a href="#mortality">Mortality</a> section. These rates depend on the
density of other fish of other sizes, as well as the carrion and
detritus biomasses, making the size-spectrum dynamics non-linear and
non-local in very interesting ways. The resulting effects are too
complicated to disentangle by pure thought. This is where simulations
with the mizer package come in.</p>
<p>There is no need to understand the mathematical notation used in the
McKendrick-von Foerster equation to understand its origin: it just says
that the rate at which the number of fish in a size bracket changes is
the rate at which fish grow into the size bracket from a smaller size
minus the rate at which fish grow out of it to a larger size minus the
rate at which the fish in the size bracket die.</p>
<p>Of course there also needs to be reproduction into the smallest size
class, otherwise there would be no small fish any more after a while. So
for the smallest size class, instead of a rate of growth into the size
class there is a rate of reproduction of new individuals into that size
class. This reproduction will be described below in the <a href="#reproduction">Reproduction</a> section.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="growth">Growth<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#growth"></a>
</h3>
<p>Consumers can grow only by consuming prey (including possibly carrion
and detritus). In the next few subsections we will build towards
determining the growth rate resulting from predation. We will discuss
how we model the <a href="#sec:pref">predator-prey encounter rate</a>,
the resulting rate of <a href="#consumption">consumption</a>, the rate
of <a href="#metabolic-losses">metabolic losses</a>, and the
partitioning of the remaining energy into <a href="#sec:repro">reproduction</a> and <a href="#somatic-growth">somatic
growth</a>.</p>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="sec:pref">Predator-prey encounter rate<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#sec:pref"></a>
</h4>
<p>The rate <span class="math inline">\(E_{i}(w)\)</span> at which a
predator of species <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> and weight
<span class="math inline">\(w\)</span> encounters food (mass per time)
is determined by summing over all prey species and integrating over all
prey sizes <span class="math inline">\(w_p\)</span>, weighted by the
selectivity factors, and (where relevant) adding the encounter rates
<span class="math inline">\(E_{C.i}\)</span> of carrion and <span class="math inline">\(E_{D.i}\)</span> of detritus: <span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:1}
  E_{i}(w) = \gamma_i(w) \int \sum_{j} \theta_{ij} N_j(w_p)
  \phi_i(w,w_p) w_p \, dw_p + E_{i.C}(w) + E_{i.D}(w).
\end{equation}\]</span> The encounter rates for <a href="#carrion-consumption">carrion</a> and <a href="#detritus-consumption">detritus</a> will be described later.</p>
<p>The overall prefactor <span class="math inline">\(\gamma_i(w)\)</span> sets the predation power of
the predator. It could be interpreted as a search volume or as an attack
rate. By default it is assumed to scale allometrically as <span class="math inline">\(\gamma_i(w) = \gamma_i\, w^{3/4}.\)</span></p>
<p>The <span class="math inline">\(\theta_{ij}\)</span> matrix sets the
interaction strength between predator species <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> prey species <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span>.</p>
<p>The size selectivity is encoded in the predation kernel <span class="math inline">\(\phi_i(w,w_p)\)</span>. For most predator species
we use the lognormal predation kernel given as <span class="math display">\[\phi_i(w, w_p) =
\exp \left[ \frac{-(\ln(w / w_p / \beta_i))^2}{2\sigma_i^2} \right]
\]</span> if <span class="math inline">\(w/w_p\)</span> is larger than 1
and zero otherwise. Here <span class="math inline">\(\beta_i\)</span> is
the preferred predator-prey mass ratio and <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_i\)</span> determines the width of the
kernel.</p>
<p>For Gurnards, Hake, Angler fish, Poor cod and Blue whiting we use a
power-law kernel with sigmoidal cutoffs given by <span class="math display">\[\phi_i(w, w_p) =
\frac{(w/w_p)^s}{\left(1+e^{l_l}\frac{w_p}{w}\right)^{u_l}
\left(1+e^{-l_r}\frac{w}{w_p}\right)^{u_r}}.
\]</span></p>
<p>Here the parameters <span class="math inline">\(l_l\)</span> and
<span class="math inline">\(u_l\)</span> determine the sigmoidal cutoff
at low predator/prey mass ratio and <span class="math inline">\(l_r\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(u_r\)</span> similarly determine the cutoff at
large predator/prey mass ratio.</p>
<p>The parameters for these predation kernels were estimated from
stomach data or from the physical characteristics of the species. This
will be discussed elsewhere.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="consumption">Consumption<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#consumption"></a>
</h4>
<p>The encountered food is consumed subject to a standard Holling
functional response type II to represent satiation. This determines the
<em>feeding level</em> <span class="math inline">\(f_i(w)\)</span>,
which is a dimensionless number between 0 (no food) and 1 (fully
satiated) so that <span class="math inline">\(1-f_i(w)\)</span> is the
proportion of the encountered food that is consumed. The feeding level
is given by</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:f}
  f_i(w) = \frac{E_i(w)}{E_i(w) + h_i(w)},
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(h_i(w)\)</span> is the maximum
consumption rate of a predator of species <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> and weight <span class="math inline">\(w\)</span>. By default we assume an allometric
form <span class="math inline">\(h_i(w) = h_i\, w^n\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(n=0.7\)</span>.</p>
<p>The rate at which food is consumed by a predator of species <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> and weight <span class="math inline">\(w\)</span> is then <span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
(1-f_i(w))E_{i}(w)=f_i(w)\, h_i(w).
\end{equation}\]</span> Only a proportion <span class="math inline">\(\alpha_i\)</span> of this consumed biomass is
retained, while a proportion <span class="math inline">\(1-\alpha_i\)</span> is expelled in the form of
feces, which contribute to the detritus.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="metabolic-losses">Metabolic losses<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#metabolic-losses"></a>
</h4>
<p>Some of the consumed food is used to fuel the needs for metabolism
and activity and movement, at a rate <span class="math inline">\({\tt
metab}_i(w)\)</span>. By default this is made up out of standard
metabolism, scaling with exponent <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>, and loss due to activity and movement,
scaling with exponent <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>: <span class="math display">\[{\tt metab}_i(w) = k_{s.i}\,w^p +
k_i\,w.\]</span></p>
<p>The remaining energy, if any, is then available for growth and
reproduction, at the rate <span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:Er}
  E_{r.i}(w) = \max(0, \alpha_i f_i(w)\, h_i(w) - {\tt metab}_i(w))
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
</div>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="sec:repro">Investment into reproduction<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#sec:repro"></a>
</h4>
<p>A proportion <span class="math inline">\(\psi_i(w)\)</span> of the
energy available for growth and reproduction is used for reproduction.
This proportion changes from zero below the weight <span class="math inline">\(w_{m.i}\)</span> of maturation to one at the
asymptotic weight <span class="math inline">\(w_{\infty.i}\)</span>,
where all available energy is used for reproduction. The expression is
<span class="math display">\[ \psi_i(w) = \begin{cases}
\left[1+\left(\frac{w}{w_{mat}}\right)^{-U}\right]^{-1}
\left(\frac{w}{w_{inf}}\right)^{m-n}&amp;w&lt;w_{inf}\\
1&amp;w\geq w_{inf}\end{cases}
\]</span></p>
<p>with <span class="math inline">\(m-n = 0.3\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(U=10\)</span> (which sets the steepness of the
sigmoidal switch-on of reproduction at around the maturity weight <span class="math inline">\(w_{mat}\)</span>). See
<code><a href="https://sizespectrum.org/mizer/reference/setReproduction.html" class="external-link">mizer::setReproduction()</a></code> for more detail.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="somatic-growth">Somatic growth<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#somatic-growth"></a>
</h4>
<p>What is left over after metabolism and reproduction is taken into
account is invested in somatic growth. Thus the growth rate of an
individual of species <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> and weight
<span class="math inline">\(w\)</span> is <span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:growth}
  g_i(w) = E_{r.i}(w)\left(1-\psi_i(w)\right).
\end{equation}\]</span> When food supply does not cover the requirements
of metabolism and activity, growth and reproduction stops, i.e. there is
no negative growth.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="mortality">Mortality<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#mortality"></a>
</h3>
<p>The mortality rate <span class="math inline">\(\mu_i(w)\)</span> of
an individual has four sources: predation mortality <span class="math inline">\(\mu_{p.i}(w)\)</span>, background mortality <span class="math inline">\(\mu_{ext.i}(w)\)</span>, fishing mortality <span class="math inline">\(\mu_{f.i}(w)\)</span> and excess gear mortality
<span class="math inline">\(\mu_{g.i}\)</span>, <span class="math display">\[\mu_i(w)=\mu_{p.i}(w)+\mu_{ext,i}(w)+\mu_{f.i}(w)+\mu_{g.i}(w).\]</span>
We will now explain each of the terms.</p>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="predation-mortality">Predation mortality<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#predation-mortality"></a>
</h4>
<p>All consumption by fish translates into corresponding predation
mortalities on the ingested prey individuals. Recalling that <span class="math inline">\(1-f_j(w)\)</span> is the proportion of the food
encountered by a predator of species <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> and weight <span class="math inline">\(w\)</span> that is actually consumed, the rate at
which all predators of species <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span>
consume prey of size <span class="math inline">\(w_p\)</span> is <span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:pred_rated}
  {\tt pred\_rate}_j(w_p) = \int \phi_j(w,w_p) (1-f_j(w))
  \gamma_j(w) N_j(w) \, dw.
\end{equation}\]</span> This predation rate is calculated by the
function <code>getPredRate()</code>.</p>
<p>The mortality rate due to predation is then obtained as <span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:mup}
  \mu_{p.i}(w_p) = \sum_j {\tt pred\_rate}_j(w_p)\, \theta_{ji}.
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
</div>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="external-mortality">External mortality<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#external-mortality"></a>
</h4>
<p>External mortality <span class="math inline">\(\mu_{ext.i}(w)\)</span> is independent of the
abundances. By default mizer assumes that the external mortality for
each species is a constant <span class="math inline">\(z0_i\)</span>
independent of size. The value of <span class="math inline">\(z0_i\)</span> is either specified as a species
parameter or it is assumed to depend allometrically on the asymptotic
size: <span class="math display">\[z0_i = z0_{pre}
w_{\infty.i}^{1-n}.\]</span></p>
</div>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="fishing-mortality">Fishing mortality<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#fishing-mortality"></a>
</h4>
<p>Fishing mortality <span class="math inline">\(\mu_{f.i}(w)\)</span>
is calculated with the function <code><a href="https://sizespectrum.org/mizer/reference/getFMort.html" class="external-link">mizer::getFMort()</a></code>. The
fishing parameters for the model are set up with
<code><a href="https://sizespectrum.org/mizer/reference/setFishing.html" class="external-link">mizer::setFishing()</a></code>, where you can find the details of how
to set up gears with different selectivities and the capabilities of
different species.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="excess-gear-mortality">Excess gear mortality<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#excess-gear-mortality"></a>
</h4>
<p>The fishing mortality only includes individuals that are hauled into
the fishing vessel. Fishing gear also causes mortality among individuals
that encounter the gear but are not caught by it. This mortality is
assumed not to be size-specific. There is a species parameter called
<code>gear_mort</code> that gives the mortality rate of an individual
imposed by the fishing gear. The part of this gear mortality that is not
fishing mortality (i.e., the part where the individuals are not taken up
to the fishing vessel but left dead in the sea) we denote as the excess
gear mortality. <span class="math display">\[\mu_{g.i} =
\max{\left(\text{gear_mort}_i - \mu_{f.i}(w), 0\right)}
\]</span></p>
<p>This excess gear mortality contributes to the carrion production.</p>

<h4 id="energy-invested-into-reproduction">Energy invested into reproduction<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#energy-invested-into-reproduction"></a>
</h4>
<p>The total rate of investment into reproduction (grams/year) is found
by integrating the contribution from all individuals of species <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>, each of which invests a proportion
<span class="math inline">\(\psi_i(w)\)</span> of their consumption.
This total rate of energy investment can then be converted to a total
rate of egg production <span class="math inline">\(R_{p.i}\)</span>
(numbers per year): <span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:Rp}
  R_{p.i} = \frac{\epsilon}{2 w_0} \int N_i(w)  E_{r.i}(w) \psi_i(w) \,
dw,
\end{equation}\]</span> Here the total rate of investment is multiplied
by an efficiency factor <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon\)</span>
and then dividing by the egg weight <span class="math inline">\(w_0\)</span> to convert the energy into number of
eggs. The result is multiplied by a factor <span class="math inline">\(1/2\)</span> to take into account that only
females reproduce.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="density-dependence-in-reproduction">Density-dependence in reproduction<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#density-dependence-in-reproduction"></a>
</h4>
<p>Three important density-dependent mechanisms widely assumed in
fisheries models are automatically captured in the mizer model that lead
to an emergent stock-recruitment relationship:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>High density of spawners leads to a reduced food income of the
spawners and consequently reduced per-capita reproduction.</li>
<li>High density of larvae leads to slower growth of larvae due to food
competition, exposing the larvae to high mortality for a longer time,
thereby decreasing the survivorship to recruitment size.</li>
<li>High density of fish leads to more predation on eggs and fish larvae
by other fish species or by cannibalism.</li>
</ol>
<p>However there are other sources of density dependence that are not
explicitly modelled mechanistically in mizer. An example would be a
limited carrying capacity of suitable spawning grounds and other spatial
effects.</p>
<p>This requires additional phenomenological density dependent
contributions to the stock-recruitment. In mizer this type of density
dependence is modelled through constraints on egg production and
survival. The default functional form of this density dependence is
represented by a reproduction rate <span class="math inline">\(R_i\)</span> (numbers per time) that approaches a
maximum as the energy invested in reproduction increases, modelled
mathematically it is analogous to a <em>Beverton-Holt</em> type
function:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:R}
  R_i = R_{\max.i} \frac{R_{p.i}}{R_{p.i} + R_{\max.i}},
\end{equation}\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(R_{\max.i}\)</span> is the maximum reproduction

<h2 id="carrion">Carrion<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#carrion"></a>
</h2>
<p>Carrion (consisting of the dead individuals that have not yet
decomposed) is an important component of the ecosystem, providing food
for scavenger species. Feeding on carrion by scavengers is not
size-based. Scavengers can feed on carrion of any size. Therefore we do
not need to describe the carrion by a size spectrum but only need to
describe its total biomass <span class="math inline">\(B_C\)</span>.</p>
<p>The rate of change in the total carrion biomass is simply the
difference between the rate at which carrion biomass is produced and the
rate at which it is consumed, so <span class="math display">\[\frac{dB_C}{dt}=p_C - c_C\,B_C.\]</span></p>
<p>We will discuss the production rate <span class="math inline">\(p_C\)</span> and the consumption rate <span class="math inline">\(c_CB_C\)</span> below.</p>

<p><span class="math inline">\(p_{C.ext}\)</span> comes from animals
that have died by natural causes other than predation (“external”): A
mizer model allows for external mortality to describe all deaths by
natural causes that are not due to predation from the modelled species.
So this external mortality would include deaths that lead to carrion,
but also deaths due to predation by species that are not explicitly
modelled, for example mammals or sea birds. Thus only a proportion of
the external mortality produces carrion. This is given by a carrion
parameter <code>ext_prop</code>. So <span class="math display">\[p_{C.ext} =

<p><span class="math inline">\(p_{C.d}\)</span> comes from discarding of

gives the proportion of the catch biomass that is discarded. This
biomass is added to the carrion biomass. Thus <span class="math display">\[p_{C.d} =

<h3 id="carrion-consumption">Carrion consumption<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#carrion-consumption"></a>
</h3>
<p>Carrion is consumed by scavengers, but also decomposed by bacteria
and other processes. The rate at which carrion biomass is consumed is
assumed to be proportional to the available carrion biomass. The
proportionality factor <span class="math inline">\(c_C\)</span>, which
we refer to as the “mass-specific consumption rate”, has one component
that depends on the abundance of consumers and a constant component
<span class="math inline">\(d_C\)</span> representing decomposition.</p>
<p>For each consumer species <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>, a
parameter <span class="math inline">\(\rho_i\)</span> determines the
rate at which individuals of that species encounter carrion biomass. The
rate is assumed to scale with the size of the predator raised to an
allometric exponent <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> which is
taken to be the same as the scaling exponent of the maximum intake rate
for consumers, <span class="math display">\[E_{i.C}(w)=\rho_i\,
w^n\,B_C.\]</span> Finally, satiation of the consumers is taken into
account via their feeding level <span class="math inline">\(f_i(w)\)</span> that was described in the section
on <a href="#consumption">consumption</a>. This gives the mass-specific
carrion consumption rate <span class="math display">\[c_C =
\sum_i\int\rho_i\, w^n N_i(w) (1-f_i(w))\,dw + d_C\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(d_C\)</span> is the mass-specific rate of

<h2 id="detritus">Detritus<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#detritus"></a>
</h2>
<p>Detritus is at the base of the benthic foodweb, providing food for
detritivores.</p>
<p>We describe the detritus as a size-spectrum <span class="math inline">\(N_D(w)\)</span> , which is the <em>density</em> of
detritus particles of size <span class="math inline">\(w\)</span>, so
that <span class="math inline">\(\int_w^{w+dw}N_D(w)dw\)</span> is the
<em>number</em> of detritus particles in the size interval <span class="math inline">\([w,w+dw]\)</span>. However, we do not know details
about the size-specific dynamics of detritus and simply assume that its
abundance is described by a power law up to a maximum size, <span class="math display">\[N_D(w) \propto \begin{cases} w^{-\lambda} &amp;
w\leq w_{cutoff}\\
0 &amp; w &gt; w_{cutoff}\end{cases}.
\]</span></p>
<p>The exponent <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> is kept
fixed and only the coefficient of the power law changes with time to
reflect the change in the total detritus biomass <span class="math display">\[B_D = \int_{w_{min}}^{w_{cutoff}} N_D(w)\, w
\,dw.\]</span></p>
<p>The rate of change in the total detritus biomass is simply the
difference between the rate at which detritus biomass is produced and
the rate at which it is consumed, so <span class="math display">\[\frac{dB_D}{dt}=p_D - c_D\,B_D.\]</span></p>
<p>We will discuss the production rate <span class="math inline">\(p_D\)</span> and the consumption rate <span class="math inline">\(c_DB_D\)</span> below.</p>
<div class="section level3">

<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="feces">Feces<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#feces"></a>

<p><span class="math inline">\(p_{C.f}\)</span> comes from the biomass

from the feces expelled by the predators. Let <span class="math inline">\(\alpha_i\)</span> be the proportion of the

<p><span class="math inline">\(p_{D.c}\)</span> comes from decomposing
carrion. As we discussed in the section on <a href="#carrion-consumption">carrion consumption</a>, carrion biomass is
decomposed to detritus at the rate <span class="math inline">\(d_CB_C\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(d_C\)</span> is a given fixed mass-specific

<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="external">External<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#external"></a>
</h4>
<p><span class="math inline">\(p_{D.ext}\)</span> is the rate at which
detritus enters the system from external sources. This will mostly be
detritus sinking in from the pelagic zone. This rate is a model
parameter independent of any other model component.</p>

<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="detritus-consumption">Detritus consumption<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#detritus-consumption"></a>

<p>The rate at which detritus biomass is consumed is assumed to be
proportional to the available detritus biomass. The proportionality
factor <span class="math inline">\(c_D\)</span>, which we refer to as
the “mass-specific consumption rate”, depends on the abundance of
consumers.</p>
<p>The consumption of detritus is modelled similarly to the consumption
of fish. First we introduce the rate at which all predators of species
<span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> consume detritus particles of
size <span class="math inline">\(w\)</span> <span class="math display">\[\mu_{D}(w_p) = \sum_j  \theta_{jD}\int
\phi_j(w,w_p) (1-f_j(w))
  \gamma_j(w) N_j(w) \, dw.
\]</span> This is analogous to the <a href="#predation-mortality">predation mortality</a> discussed earlier,
but with <span class="math inline">\(\theta_{jD}\)</span> determining
the strength at which species <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span>
feeds on detritus. To get the total rate of detritus consumption we
multiply by the weight of the detritus particle and integrate over all
detritus particles: <span class="math display">\[c_DB_D=\int\mu_D(w_p)\,w_p\, N_D(w_p)\,dw_p.
\]</span> Because we keep the size-distribution of the detritus fixed,
this consumption rate is proportional to the total detritus biomass
<span class="math inline">\(B_D\)</span>, as we have already indicated
by our notation.</p>

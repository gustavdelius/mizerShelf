<p>On this page we present the details of the model. We will also provide links to the functions that can be used to set or change the various model parameters as well as to the functions that calculate the various ecological rates in the model. The help pages of these functions will provide useful additional details. The model is implemented by extending the <a href="https://sizespectrum.org/mizer">mizer package</a>.</p>
<div id="size-spectrum-dynamics" class="section level1">
<h1 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#size-spectrum-dynamics" class="anchor"></a>Size spectrum dynamics</h1>
<div id="species-size-spectra" class="section level2">
<h2 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#species-size-spectra" class="anchor"></a>Species size spectra</h2>
<p>The model assumes that, to a first approximation, an individual can be characterized by its weight <span class="math inline">\(w\)</span> and its species number <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> only. The aim of the model is to calculate the size spectrum <span class="math inline">\(N_i(w)\)</span>, which is the <em>density</em> of individuals of species <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(\int_w^{w+dw}N_i(w)dw\)</span> is the <em>number</em> of individuals of species <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> in the size interval <span class="math inline">\([w,w+dw]\)</span>. In other words: the number of individuals in a size range is the area under the number density <span class="math inline">\(N_i(w)\)</span>.</p>
<p>The time evolution of the number density <span class="math inline">\(N_i(w)\)</span> is described by the McKendrick-von Foerster equation, which is a transport equation describing the transport of biomass from small to large individuals, with an additional loss term due to fish mortality:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:MvF}
  \frac{\partial N_i(w)}{\partial t} + \frac{\partial g_i(w) N_i(w)}{\partial w} 
  = -\mu_i(w) N_i(w),
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p>where individual growth <span class="math inline">\(g_i(w)\)</span> is described below in the <a href="#growth">Growth</a> section and mortality <span class="math inline">\(\mu_i(w)\)</span> is described in the <a href="#mortality">Mortality</a> section.</p>
<p>There is no need to understand the mathematical notation used in this equation to understand its origin: it just says that the rate at which the number of fish in a size bracket changes is the rate at which fish grow into the size bracket from a smaller size minus the rate at which fish grow out of it to a larger size minus the rate at which the fish in the size bracket die. So to simulate the size spectrum dynamics we need to specify the growth rates and the mortality rates. This we will do below. The important point is that these rates depend on the density of other fish of other sizes, as well as the carrion and detritus biomasses, making the size-spectrum dynamics non-linear and non-local in very interesting ways. The resulting effects are too complicated to disentangle by pure thought. This is where simulations with the mizer package come in.</p>
<p>This McKendrick-von Foerster equation is approximated in mizer by a finite-difference method. This allows the <code><a href="https://sizespectrum.org/mizer/reference/project.html">mizer::project()</a></code> function to project the size spectrum forwards in time: Given the spectrum at one time the <code><a href="https://sizespectrum.org/mizer/reference/project.html">mizer::project()</a></code> function calculates it at a set of later times.</p>
<p>Of course there also needs to be reproduction into the smallest size class, otherwise there would be no small fish any more after a while. So for the smallest size class instead of a rate of growth into the size class there is a rate of reproduction of new individuals into that size class. This reproduction will be described below in the <a href="#reproduction">Reproduction</a> section.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="growth" class="section level1">
<h1 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#growth" class="anchor"></a>Growth</h1>
<p>Consumers can grow only by consuming prey (including possibly carrion and detritus). In the next few subsections we will build towards determining the growth rate resulting from predation. We will discuss how we model the <a href="#sec:pref">predator-prey encounter rate</a>, the resulting rate of <a href="#consumption">consumption</a>, the rate of <a href="#metabolic-losses">metabolic losses</a>, and the partitioning of the remaining energy into <a href="#sec:repro">reproduction</a> and <a href="#resulting-growth">growth</a>.</p>
<div id="sec:pref" class="section level2">
<h2 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#sec:pref" class="anchor"></a>Predator-prey encounter rate</h2>
<p>The rate <span class="math inline">\(E_{i}(w)\)</span> at which a predator of species <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> and weight <span class="math inline">\(w\)</span> encounters food (mass per time) is determined by summing over all prey species and integrating over all prey sizes <span class="math inline">\(w_p\)</span>, weighted by the selectivity factors, and (where relevant) adding the encounter rates <span class="math inline">\(E_{i.C}\)</span> of carrion and <span class="math inline">\(E_{i.D}\)</span> of detritus: <span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:1}
  E_{i}(w) = \gamma_i(w) \int \sum_{j} \theta_{ij} N_j(w_p)
  \phi_i(w,w_p) w_p \, dw_p + E_{i.C}(w) + E_{i.D}(w).
\end{equation}\]</span> This is calculated by <code><a href="https://sizespectrum.org/mizer/reference/getEncounter.html">mizer::getEncounter()</a></code>. The encounter rates for <a href="#carrion">carrion</a> and <a href="#detritus">detritus</a> will be described later.</p>
<p>The overall prefactor <span class="math inline">\(\gamma_i(w)\)</span> sets the predation power of the predator. It could be interpreted as a search volume or as an attack rate. By default it is assumed to scale allometrically as <span class="math inline">\(\gamma_i(w) = \gamma_i\, w^q.\)</span></p>
<p>The <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> matrix sets the interaction strength between predators and the various prey species and resource. It is changed with <code><a href="https://sizespectrum.org/mizer/reference/setInteraction.html">mizer::setInteraction()</a></code>.</p>
<p>The size selectivity is encoded in the predation kernel <span class="math inline">\(\phi_i(w,w_p)\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<div id="consumption" class="section level2">
<h2 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#consumption" class="anchor"></a>Consumption</h2>
<p>The encountered food is consumed subject to a standard Holling functional response type II to represent satiation. This determines the <em>feeding level</em> <span class="math inline">\(f_i(w)\)</span>, which is a dimensionless number between 0 (no food) and 1 (fully satiated) so that <span class="math inline">\(1-f_i(w)\)</span> is the proportion of the encountered food that is consumed. The feeding level is given by</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:f}
  f_i(w) = \frac{E_i(w)}{E_i(w) + h_i(w)},
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(h_i(w)\)</span> is the maximum consumption rate. By default mizer assumes an allometric form <span class="math inline">\(h_i(w) = h_i\, w^n.\)</span> The feeding level is calculated with the function <code><a href="https://sizespectrum.org/mizer/reference/getFeedingLevel.html">mizer::getFeedingLevel()</a></code>.</p>
<p>The rate at which food is consumed is then <span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
(1-f_i(w))E_{i}(w)=f_i(w)\, h_i(w).
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
</div>
<div id="metabolic-losses" class="section level2">
<h2 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#metabolic-losses" class="anchor"></a>Metabolic losses</h2>
<p>Some of the consumed food is used to fuel the needs for metabolism and activity and movement, at a rate <span class="math inline">\({\tt metab}_i(w)\)</span>. By default this is made up out of standard metabolism, scaling with exponent <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>, and loss due to activity and movement, scaling with exponent <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>: <span class="math display">\[{\tt metab}_i(w) = k_{s.i}\,w^p + k_i\,w.\]</span></p>
<p>The remaining biomass, if any, is assimilated with an efficiency <span class="math inline">\(\alpha_i\)</span> and is then available for growth and reproduction. So the rate at which energy becomes available for growth and reproduction is <span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:Er}
  E_{r.i}(w) = \max(0, \alpha_i f_i(w)\, h_i(w) - {\tt metab}_i(w))
\end{equation}\]</span> This is calculated with the <code><a href="https://sizespectrum.org/mizer/reference/getEReproAndGrowth.html">mizer::getEReproAndGrowth()</a></code> function.</p>
</div>
<div id="sec:repro" class="section level2">
<h2 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#sec:repro" class="anchor"></a>Investment into reproduction</h2>
<p>A proportion <span class="math inline">\(\psi_i(w)\)</span> of the energy available for growth and reproduction is used for reproduction. This proportion changes from zero below the weight <span class="math inline">\(w_{m.i}\)</span> of maturation to one at the asymptotic weight <span class="math inline">\(w_{\infty.i}\)</span>, where all available energy is used for reproduction. See <code><a href="https://sizespectrum.org/mizer/reference/setReproduction.html">mizer::setReproduction()</a></code> for more detail.</p>
</div>
<div id="resulting-growth" class="section level2">
<h2 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#resulting-growth" class="anchor"></a>Resulting growth</h2>
<p>What is left over after metabolism and reproduction is taken into account is invested in somatic growth. Thus the growth rate is <span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:growth}
  g_i(w) = E_{r.i}(w)\left(1-\psi_i(w)\right).
\end{equation}\]</span> It is calculated by the <code><a href="https://sizespectrum.org/mizer/reference/getEGrowth.html">mizer::getEGrowth()</a></code> function.</p>
<p>When food supply does not cover the requirements of metabolism and activity, growth and reproduction stops, i.e. there is no negative growth.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="mortality" class="section level1">
<h1 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#mortality" class="anchor"></a>Mortality</h1>
<p>The mortality rate of an individual <span class="math inline">\(\mu_i(w)\)</span> has four sources: predation mortality <span class="math inline">\(\mu_{p.i}(w)\)</span>, background mortality <span class="math inline">\(\mu_{ext.i}(w)\)</span>, fishing mortality <span class="math inline">\(\mu_{f.i}(w)\)</span> and excess gear mortality <span class="math inline">\(\mu_{g.i}\)</span>.</p>
<p>Predation mortality is calculated such that all that is eaten translates into corresponding predation mortalities on the ingested prey individuals. Recalling that <span class="math inline">\(1-f_j(w)\)</span> is the proportion of the food encountered by a predator of species <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> and weight <span class="math inline">\(w\)</span> that is actually consumed, the rate at which all predators of species <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> consume prey of size <span class="math inline">\(w_p\)</span> is <span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:pred_rated}
  {\tt pred\_rate}_j(w_p) = \int \phi_j(w,w_p) (1-f_j(w))
  \gamma_j(w) N_j(w) \, dw.
\end{equation}\]</span> This predation rate is calculated by the function <code>getPredRate()</code>.</p>
<p>The mortality rate due to predation is then obtained as <span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:mup}
  \mu_{p.i}(w_p) = \sum_j {\tt pred\_rate}_j(w_p)\, \theta_{ji}.
\end{equation}\]</span> This predation mortality rate is calculated by the function <code><a href="https://sizespectrum.org/mizer/reference/getPredMort.html">mizer::getPredMort()</a></code>.</p>
<p>External mortality <span class="math inline">\(\mu_{ext.i}(w)\)</span> is independent of the abundances. By default mizer assumes that the external mortality for each species is a constant <span class="math inline">\(z0_i\)</span> independent of size. The value of <span class="math inline">\(z0_i\)</span> is either specified as a species parameter or it is assumed to depend allometrically on the asymptotic size: <span class="math display">\[z0_i = z0_{pre} w_{\infty.i}^{1-n}.\]</span></p>
<p>Fishing mortality <span class="math inline">\(\mu_{f.i}(w)\)</span> is calculated with the function <code><a href="https://sizespectrum.org/mizer/reference/getFMort.html">mizer::getFMort()</a></code>. The fishing parameters for the model are set up with <code><a href="https://sizespectrum.org/mizer/reference/setFishing.html">mizer::setFishing()</a></code>, where you can find the details of how to set up gears with different selectivities and the capabilities of different species.</p>
<p>The fishing mortality only includes individuals that are hauled into the fishing vessel. Fishing gear also causes mortality among individuals that encounter the gear but are not caught by it. This mortality is assumed not to be size-specific. There is a species parameter <span class="math inline">\(g_i\)</span>, called <code>gear_mort</code> that gives the mortality rate of an individual imposed by the fishing gear. The part of this gear mortality that is not fishing mortality (i.e., the part where the individuals are not taken up to the fishing vessel but left dead in the sea) contributes to the carrion production. \max{(g_i - _{f.i}(w), 0)</p>
<p>The total mortality rate <span class="math display">\[\mu_i(w)=\mu_{p.i}(w)+\mu_{ext,u}(w)+\mu_{f.i}(w)\]</span> is calculated with the function <code><a href="https://sizespectrum.org/mizer/reference/getMort.html">mizer::getMort()</a></code>.</p>

<div id="reproduction" class="section level1">
<h1 class="hasAnchor">

<div id="energy-invested-into-reproduction" class="section level2">
<h2 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#energy-invested-into-reproduction" class="anchor"></a>Energy invested into reproduction</h2>
<p>The total rate of investment into reproduction (grams/year) is found by integrating the contribution from all individuals of species <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>, each of which invests a proportion <span class="math inline">\(\psi_i(w)\)</span> of their consumption. This total rate of energy investment can then be converted to a total rate of egg production <span class="math inline">\(R_{p.i}\)</span> (numbers per year): <span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:Rp}
  R_{p.i} = \frac{\epsilon}{2 w_0} \int N_i(w)  E_{r.i}(w) \psi_i(w) \, dw,
\end{equation}\]</span> Here the total rate of investment is multiplied by an efficiency factor <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon\)</span> and then dividing by the egg weight <span class="math inline">\(w_0\)</span> to convert the energy into number of eggs. The result is multiplied by a factor <span class="math inline">\(1/2\)</span> to take into account that only females reproduce. This rate of potential egg production is calculated with <code>getRDI()</code>.</p>
</div>
<div id="density-dependence-in-reproduction" class="section level2">
<h2 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#density-dependence-in-reproduction" class="anchor"></a>Density-dependence in reproduction</h2>
<p>Three important density-dependent mechanisms widely assumed in fisheries models are automatically captured in the mizer model that lead to an emergent stock-recruitment relationship:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>High density of spawners leads to a reduced food income of the spawners and consequently reduced per-capita reproduction.</li>
<li>High density of larvae leads to slower growth of larvae due to food competition, exposing the larvae to high mortality for a longer time, thereby decreasing the survivorship to recruitment size.</li>
<li>High density of fish leads to more predation on eggs and fish larvae by other fish species or by cannibalism.</li>
</ol>
<p>However there are other sources of density dependence that are not explicitly modelled mechanistically in mizer. An example would be a limited carrying capacity of suitable spawning grounds and other spatial effects.</p>
<p>This requires additional phenomenological density dependent contributions to the stock-recruitment. In mizer this type of density dependence is modelled through constraints on egg production and survival. The default functional form of this density dependence is represented by a reproduction rate <span class="math inline">\(R_i\)</span> (numbers per time) that approaches a maximum as the energy invested in reproduction increases, modelled mathematically it is analogous to a <em>Beverton-Holt</em> type function:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:R}
  R_i = R_{\max.i} \frac{R_{p.i}}{R_{p.i} + R_{\max.i}},
\end{equation}\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(R_{\max.i}\)</span> is the maximum reproduction rate of each trait class. This final rate of reproduction is calculated with <code>getRDD()</code>.</p>
<p>This default <em>Beverton-Holt</em> type is implemented by <code>BervertonHoldRDD()</code> but mizer also provides alternatives <code>RickerRDD()</code>, <code>SheperdRDD()</code>, <code>constantRDD()</code> and <code>noRDD()</code>. Also, users are able to write their own functions, e.g. <em>hockey-stick</em>. See <code>setReproduction()</code> for details.</p>
</div>
<div id="carrion" class="section level2">
<h2 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#carrion" class="anchor"></a>Carrion</h2>
<p>Carrion (dead individuals) is an important component of the ecosystem, providing food for scavenger species. Feeding on carrion by scavengers is not size-based. Scavengers can feed on carrion of any size. Therefore we do not need to describe the carrion by a size spectrum but only need to describe its total biomass <span class="math inline">\(B_C\)</span>.</p>
<div id="carrion-production" class="section level3">
<h3 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#carrion-production" class="anchor"></a>Carrion production</h3>
<p>Carrion is produced by the ecosystem at a rate <span class="math inline">\(p_C\)</span>. This rate has contributions from three sources, <span class="math inline">\(p_C = p_{C.e} + p_{C.g} + p_{C.d}\)</span>.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(p_{C.e}\)</span> comes from animals that have died by natural causes other than predation (“external”): A mizer model allows for external mortality to describe all deaths by natural causes that are not due to predation from the modelled species. So this external mortality would include deaths that lead to carrion, but also deaths due to predation by species that are not explicitly modelled, for example mammals or sea birds. Thus only a proportion of the external mortality produces carrion. There is given by a carrion parameter <span class="math inline">\(e\)</span>, called <code>ext_prop</code>. So <span class="math display">\[p_{C.e} = e\,\sum_i\int\mu_{ext.i}(w)N_i(w)w\,dw.\]</span></p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(p_{C.g}\)</span> comes from animals killed by the fishing gear (“gear_mort”): There is a species parameter <span class="math inline">\(g_i\)</span>, called <code>gear_mort</code> that gives the mortality rate of an individual imposed by the fishing gear. The part of this gear mortality that is not fishing mortality (i.e., the part where the individuals are not taken up to the fishing vessel but left dead in the sea) contributes to the carrion production. If the fishing mortality is greater than the gear mortality then no carrion is produced. <span class="math display">\[p_{C.g} = \sum_i\int\max{\left(g_i - \mu_{f.i}(w), 0\right)}N_i(w)w\,dw.\]</span></p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(p_{C.d}\)</span> comes from discarding of fished animals (“discards”): There is a species parameter <span class="math inline">\(d_i\)</span>, called <code>discard</code>, that gives the proportion of the catch biomass that is discarded. This biomass is added to the carrion biomass. Thus <span class="math display">\[p_{C.d} = \sum_i\,d_i\int\mu_{f.i}(w)N_i(w)w\,dw.\]</span></p></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="carrion-consumption" class="section level3">
<h3 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#carrion-consumption" class="anchor"></a>Carrion consumption</h3>
<p>The rate at which carrion biomass is consumed is assumed to be proportional to the available carrion biomass. The proportionality factor <span class="math inline">\(c_C\)</span>, which we refer to as the “mass-specific consumption rate”, depends on the abundance of consumers. For each consumer species, a parameter <span class="math inline">\(\rho_i\)</span> determines the rate at which individuals of that species consume carrion biomass. The actual per capita consumption rate scales with the size of the predator raised to an allometric exponent <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> which is taken to be the same as the scaling exponent of the maximum intake rate for consumers. Finally, satiation of the consumers is taken into account via their feeding level <span class="math inline">\(f_i(w)\)</span> that will be described later. This gives the mass-specific consumption rate <span class="math display">\[c_C = \sum_i\,d_i\int\rho_i\, w^n N_i(w) (1-f_i(w))\,dw.\]</span></p>

<p>The rate of change in the total carrion biomass is simply the difference between the rate at which carrion biomass is produced and the rate at which it is consumed, so <span class="math display">\[\frac{dB_C}{dt}=p_C - c_C\,B_c.\]</span></p>

<p>Besides the fish spectrum there is also a resource spectrum <span class="math inline">\(N_R(w)\)</span>, representing for example the phytoplankton. This spectrum starts at a smaller size than the fish spectrum, in order to provide food also for the smallest individuals (larvae) of the fish spectrum.</p>

<div id="resource-mortality" class="section level2">
<h2 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#resource-mortality" class="anchor"></a>Resource Mortality</h2>
<p>The predation mortality rate on resource is given by a similar expression as the predation mortality on fish: <span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:mupp}
  \mu_{p}(w_p) = \sum_j {\tt pred\_rate}_j(w_p)\, \theta_{jp}.
\end{equation}\]</span> This is the only mortality on resource currently implemented in mizer. It is calculated with the function <code>getResourceMort()</code>.</p>

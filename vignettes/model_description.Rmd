On this page we present the details of the model. We will also provide links
to the functions that can be used to set or change the various model parameters
as well as to the functions that
calculate the various ecological rates in the model.
The help pages of these functions will provide useful
additional details. The model is implemented by extending the 
[mizer package](https://sizespectrum.org/mizer).


# Size spectrum dynamics

## Species size spectra
The model assumes that, to a first approximation, an individual can be
characterized by its weight $w$ and its species number $i$ only. The aim of the
model is to calculate the size spectrum $N_i(w)$, which is the *density* of
individuals of species $i$ such that $\int_w^{w+dw}N_i(w)dw$ is the *number* of
individuals of species $i$ in the size interval $[w,w+dw]$. In other words: the
number of individuals in a size range is the area under the number density
$N_i(w)$.

The time evolution of the number density $N_i(w)$ is described by the 
McKendrick-von Foerster equation, which is a transport equation describing
the transport of biomass from small to large individuals,
with an additional loss term due to fish mortality:

\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:MvF}
  \frac{\partial N_i(w)}{\partial t} + \frac{\partial g_i(w) N_i(w)}{\partial w} 
  = -\mu_i(w) N_i(w),
\end{equation}

where individual growth $g_i(w)$ and mortality $\mu_i(w)$ will be described
below. 

There is no need to understand the mathematical notation used in
this equation to understand its origin: it just says that the rate at which the
number of fish in a size bracket changes is the rate at which fish grow into the
size bracket from a smaller size minus the rate at which fish grow out of it to
a larger size minus the rate at which the fish in the size bracket die. So to
simulate the size spectrum dynamics we need to specify the growth rates and the
mortality rates. This we will do below. The important point is that these rates
depend on the density of other fish of other sizes, as well as the carrion
and detritus biomasses, making the size-spectrum
dynamics non-linear and non-local in very interesting ways. The resulting
effects are too complicated to disentangle by pure thought. This is where
simulations with the mizer package come in.

This McKendrick-von Foerster equation is approximated in mizer by a
finite-difference method. This allows the
`project()` function in mizer to project the size
spectrum forwards in time: Given the spectrum at one time the `project()`
function calculates it at a set of later times.

Of course there also needs to be reproduction into the smallest size class,
otherwise there would be no small fish any more after a while. So for the
smallest size class instead of a rate of growth into the size class there is
a rate of reproduction of new individuals into that size class. This
reproduction will be described further below.

## Carrion

Carrion (dead individuals) is an important component of the ecosystem,
providing food for scavenger species. Feeding on carrion by scavengers
is not size-based. Scavengers can feed on carrion of any size. Therefore
we do not need to describe the carrion by a size spectrum but only need
to describe its total biomass $B_C$.

### Carrion production
Carrion is produced by the ecosystem at a rate $p_C$. This rate has
contributions from three sources, $p_C = p_{C.e} + p_{C.g} + p_{C.d}$.

1. $p_{C.e}$ comes from animals that have died by natural causes other than predation ("external"):
  A mizer model allows for external mortality to describe all deaths by
  natural causes that are not due to predation from the modelled species.
  So this external mortality would include deaths that lead to carrion,
  but also deaths due to predation by species that
  are not explicitly modelled, for example mammals or sea birds. Thus only
  a proportion of the external mortality produces carrion.
  There is given by a carrion parameter $e$, called `ext_prop`. So
  $$p_{C.e} = e\,\sum_i\int\mu_{ext.i}(w)N_i(w)w\,dw.$$

2. $p_{C.g}$ comes from animals killed by the fishing gear ("gear_mort"):
  There is a species parameter $g_i$, called `gear_mort` that gives the 
  mortality rate of an individual imposed by the fishing gear. The part of
  this gear mortality that is not fishing mortality (i.e., the part where the
  individuals are not taken up to the fishing vessel but left dead in the sea)
  contributes to the carrion production. If the fishing mortality is greater
  than the gear mortality then no carrion is produced.
  $$p_{C.g} = \sum_i\int\max{\left(g_i - \mu_{f.i}(w), 0\right)}N_i(w)w\,dw.$$

3. $p_{C.d}$ comes from discarding of fished animals ("discards"):
  There is a species parameter $d_i$, called `discard`, that gives the proportion of
  the catch biomass that is discarded. This biomass is added to the carrion
  biomass. Thus
  $$p_{C.d} = \sum_i\,d_i\int\mu_{f.i}(w)N_i(w)w\,dw.$$

### Carrion consumption
The rate at which carrion biomass is consumed is assumed to be proportional to the
available carrion biomass. The proportionality factor $c_C$, which we refer to
as the "mass-specific consumption rate", depends on the
abundance of consumers.
For each consumer species, a parameter $\rho_i$ determines the rate at which individuals
of that species consume carrion biomass. The actual per capita consumption
rate scales with the size of the predator raised to an allometric exponent $n$
which is taken to be the same as the scaling exponent of the maximum intake rate
for consumers. Finally, satiation of the consumers is taken into account
via their feeding level $f_i(w)$ that will be described later. This gives the mass-specific
consumption rate
$$c_C = \sum_i\,d_i\int\rho_i\, w^n N_i(w) (1-f_i(w))\,dw.$$

### Carrion dynamics
The rate of change in the total carrion biomass is simply the difference
between the rate at which carrion biomass is produced and the rate at which
it is consumed, so
$$\frac{dB_C}{dt}=p_C - c_C\,B_c.$$

## Detritus

Besides the fish spectrum there is also a resource spectrum $N_R(w)$,
representing for example the phytoplankton. This spectrum starts at a smaller
size than the fish spectrum, in order to provide food also for the smallest
individuals (larvae) of the fish spectrum.



# Growth

Consumers can grow only by consuming prey. In the next few subsections we will
build towards determining the growth rate resulting from predation.
We will discuss how we model the predator-prey encounter rate, the resulting rate
of consumption, the rate of loss due to metabolism, and the partitioning of the
remaining energy into reproduction and growth.

## Predator-prey encounter rate {#sec:pref}

The rate at which a predator of species $i$ and weight $w$ encounters food 
(mass per time) is
determined by summing over all prey species and the resource spectrum and
integrating over all prey sizes $w_p$, weighted by the selectivity factors:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:1}
  E_{i}(w) = \gamma_i(w) \int \left(\sum_{j} \theta_{ij} N_j(w_p) +
   \theta_{iR} N_R(w_p) \right) 
  \phi_i(w,w_p) w_p \, dw_p.
\end{equation}
This is calculated by `getEncounter()`.
The overall prefactor $\gamma_i(w)$ sets the predation power of the predator. It
could be interpreted as a search volume. It is set by `setSearchVolume()`. By 
default it is assumed to scale allometrically as
$\gamma_i(w) = \gamma_i\, w^q.$

The $\theta$ matrix sets the interaction strength between predators and the
various prey species and resource. It is changed with `setInteraction()`.

The size selectivity is encoded in the predation kernel $\phi_i(w,w_p)$. This is
changed with `setPredKernel()`.

<details>
An important simplification occurs when the predation kernel $\phi_i(w,w_p)$
depends on the size of the prey **only** through the predator/prey size ratio
$w_p/w$,
\[\phi_i(w, w_p)=\tilde{\phi}_i(w/w_p).\]
This is assumed by default but can be overruled.
The default for the predation kernel is the truncated log-normal function
\[
  \label{eq:4}
  \tilde{\phi}_i(x) = \begin{cases}
  \exp \left[ \dfrac{-(\ln(x / \beta_i))^2}{2\sigma_i^2} \right]
  &\text{ if }x\in\left[0,\beta_i\exp(3\sigma_i)\right]\\
  0&\text{ otherwise,}
  \end{cases}
\]
where $\beta_i$ is the preferred predator-prey mass ratio and $\sigma_i$ sets
the width of the predation kernel.

The integral in the expression for the encounter rate is approximated by a 
Riemann sum over all weight brackets:
\[
{\tt encounter}[i,a] = {\tt search\_vol}[i,a]\sum_{k}
\left( n_{R}[k] + \sum_{j} \theta[i,j] n[j,k] \right) 
  \phi_i\left(w[a],w[k]\right) w[k]\, dw[k].
\]
In the case of a predation kernel that depends on $w/w_p$ only, this becomes
a convolution sum and can be evaluated efficiently via fast Fourier transform.

</details>


## Consumption

The encountered food is consumed subjected to a standard Holling functional 
response type II to represent satiation. This determines the 
*feeding level* $f_i(w)$, which is a dimensionless number between 0 
(no food) and 1 (fully satiated) so that $1-f_i(w)$ is the proportion of the
encountered food that is consumed. The feeding level is given by

\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:f}
  f_i(w) = \frac{E_i(w)}{E_i(w) + h_i(w)},
\end{equation}

where $h_i(w)$ is the maximum consumption rate. This is changed with
`setMaxIntakeRate()`. By default mizer assumes an allometric form
$h_i(w) = h_i\, w^n.$
The feeding level is calculated with the function `getFeedingLevel()`.

The rate at which food is consumed is then 
\begin{equation}
(1-f_i(w))E_{i}(w)=f_i(w)\, h_i(w).
\end{equation}

## Metabolic losses

Some of the consumed food is used to fuel the needs for metabolism and 
activity and movement, at a rate ${\tt metab}_i(w)$. By default 
this is made up out of standard metabolism, scaling with exponent $p$, and
loss due to activity and movement, scaling with exponent $1$:
\[{\tt metab}_i(w) = k_{s.i}\,w^p + k_i\,w.\]
See the help page for `setMetabolicRate()`. 

The remaining rate, if any, is assimilated with an efficiency $\alpha_i$ and 
is then available for growth and reproduction. So the rate at which energy
becomes available for growth and reproduction is
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:Er}
  E_{r.i}(w) = \max(0, \alpha_i f_i(w)\, h_i(w) - {\tt metab}_i(w))
\end{equation}
This is calculated with the `getEReproAndGrowth()` function.


## Investment into reproduction  {#sec:repro}
A proportion $\psi_i(w)$ of the energy available for growth and reproduction is
used for reproduction. This proportion should change from zero below the weight
$w_{m.i}$ of maturation to one at the asymptotic weight $w_{\infty.i}$, where
all available energy is used for reproduction. This function is changed with
`setReproduction()`. Mizer provides a default form for the function which you
can however overrule.



## Growth
What is left over after metabolism and reproduction is taken into account
is invested in somatic growth. Thus the growth rate is
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:growth}
  g_i(w) = E_{r.i}(w)\left(1-\psi_i(w)\right).
\end{equation}
It is calculated by the `getEGrowth()` function.

When food supply does not cover the requirements of metabolism and activity, 
growth and reproduction stops, i.e. there is no negative growth.
The individual should then be subjected to a starvation mortality, but starvation
mortality is not implemented in mizer at the moment.


# Mortality
The mortality rate of an individual $\mu_i(w)$ has three sources: 
predation mortality $\mu_{p.i}(w)$, background mortality $\mu_{ext.i}(w)$ and 
fishing mortality $\mu_{f.i}(w)$. 

Predation mortality is calculated such that all that is eaten translates into 
corresponding predation mortalities on the ingested prey individuals. 
Recalling that $1-f_j(w)$ is the proportion of the food encountered by a 
predator of species $j$ and weight $w$ that is actually consumed, the
rate at which all predators of species $j$ consume prey of size $w_p$ is
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:pred_rated}
  {\tt pred\_rate}_j(w_p) = \int \phi_j(w,w_p) (1-f_j(w))
  \gamma_j(w) N_j(w) \, dw.
\end{equation}
This predation rate is calculated by the function `getPredRate()`.

<details>
The integral is approximated by a Riemann sum over all fish weight brackets.
\[
{\tt pred\_rate}[j,c] = \sum_{a}
  {\tt pred_kernel}[j,a,c]\,(1-{\tt feeding_level}[j,a])\,
  \gamma[j,a]\,n[j,a]\,dw[a].
\]

</details>

The mortality rate due to predation is then obtained as
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:mup}
  \mu_{p.i}(w_p) = \sum_j {\tt pred\_rate}_j(w_p)\, \theta_{ji}.
\end{equation}
This predation mortality rate is calculated by the function `getPredMort()`.

External mortality $\mu_{ext.i}(w)$ is independent of the abundances and is
changed with `setExtMort()`. By default mizer assumes that the external
mortality for each species is a constant $z0_i$ independent of size. The value
of $z0_i$ is either specified as a species parameter or it is assumed to
depend allometrically on the asymptotic size:
\[z0_i = z0_{pre} w_{\infty.i}^{1-n}.\]


## Fishing mortality
The fishing parameters for the model are set up with `setFishing()`, where
you can find the details of how to set up gears with different selectivities
and the capabilities of different species.
Fishing mortality $\mu_{f.i}(w)$ is calculated with the function `getFMort()`.

## Total mortality
The total mortality rate
\[\mu_i(w)=\mu_{p.i}(w)+\mu_{ext,u}(w)+\mu_{f.i}(w)\]
is calculated with the function `getMort()`.


## Resource Mortality

The predation mortality rate on resource is given by a similar expression
as the predation mortality on fish:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:mupp}
  \mu_{p}(w_p) = \sum_j {\tt pred\_rate}_j(w_p)\, \theta_{jp}.
\end{equation}
This is the only mortality on resource currently implemented in mizer.
It is calculated with the function `getResourceMort()`.



# Reproduction

## Energy invested into reproduction

The total rate of investment into reproduction (grams/year) is
found by integrating the contribution from all individuals of species $i$,
each of which invests a proportion $\psi_i(w)$ of their consumption. This
total rate of energy investment can then be converted to a total rate of
egg production $R_{p.i}$ (numbers per year):
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:Rp}
  R_{p.i} = \frac{\epsilon}{2 w_0} \int N_i(w)  E_{r.i}(w) \psi_i(w) \, dw,
\end{equation}
Here the total rate of investment is multiplied by an efficiency factor $\epsilon$ 
and then dividing by the egg weight $w_0$ to convert the energy into number of eggs.
The result is multiplied by a factor $1/2$ to take into account that only 
females reproduce. This rate of potential egg production is calculated with
`getRDI()`.


## Density-dependence in reproduction

Three important density-dependent mechanisms widely assumed in fisheries models are 
automatically captured in the mizer model that lead to an emergent stock-recruitment relationship:

1. High density of spawners leads to a reduced
food income of the spawners and consequently reduced per-capita reproduction.
2. High density of larvae leads to slower growth of larvae due to food 
competition, exposing the larvae to high mortality for a longer time, thereby
decreasing the survivorship to recruitment size.
3. High density of fish leads to more predation on eggs and fish larvae by
other fish species or by cannibalism.

However there are other sources of density dependence that are not explicitly
modelled mechanistically in mizer. An example would be a limited carrying capacity of suitable
spawning grounds and other spatial effects.

This requires additional phenomenological density dependent contributions to the stock-recruitment. In mizer this type of density dependence is modelled through constraints on egg production and survival. 
The default functional form of this density dependence is represented by
a reproduction rate $R_i$ (numbers per time) that approaches a maximum as the 
energy invested in reproduction increases, modelled mathematically it is analogous to 
a *Beverton-Holt* type function:

\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:R}
  R_i = R_{\max.i} \frac{R_{p.i}}{R_{p.i} + R_{\max.i}},
\end{equation}
where $R_{\max.i}$ is the maximum reproduction rate of each trait class. 
This final rate of reproduction is calculated with `getRDD()`.

This default *Beverton-Holt* type is implemented by `BervertonHoldRDD()` but
mizer also provides alternatives `RickerRDD()`, `SheperdRDD()`, `constantRDD()`
and `noRDD()`. Also, users are able to write their own functions, e.g.
*hockey-stick*. See `setReproduction()` for details.
